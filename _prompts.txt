We are talking about my current project (code below). I hope vercel provide some free DB/storage.
How much effort would it be to do
- admin login/secure
- super simple
- capture client name, contacts (priority) facebook messager, insta, whatsapp, telegram, mobile; some notes
- capture photo(s) on mobile directly to contact (or take from phone gallery)
- history of client contact (date, notes)
- Past and coming projects: date, location, status: done, confirmed, planned, suggested, idea
- For done: a few links to shared folders
- most of the time single client per project but could be more
- client per multiple project
- Quick search by client, date, project location
- quick access to information on desktop and mob

    add new component Hidden
    I want a new component to list all folder on dropbox which start with "_" I name them hidden because we don't want
    them to be used for Category,
    I want Hidden to routed but not on a menu
    To get names from dropbox can reuse api/categories but need to toggle if we get as it is now
    Once we have list of hidden categories we expect them in format _2005_name
    For each we need to give 4 Year Name and 2 links, the first link to Small (category/_2005_name/small) and Large (category/_2005_name/large)
    Allow to filter by year or name, and sort by year or name
    Name is very short so be creative with design so it doesn't look too empty

    Let's redesign menu
    It will only have one level of menu items
    Keep font thin and light
    Items should be as the following:
    home - same as current Home
    list of categories
    list of playlists
    contact - same as current Contact
    about - same as current About

    Let's completely change Videos. I want it to display all videos from the list as tiles. 2 columns on desktop an 1 on mobile.
    Each tile would have Thumbnail for video, title and the beginning of the description with some way to extend it if clicked.
    There should be some way to click to open video in Youtube (site or application on mobile). Everything should look very elegant
    and match the rest of site.

    Tiles are not lined up properly. Let's redesign it a bit.
    Keep tile design, up to 5 column on desktop, no less than 2 on both mobile and desktop.
    Show thumbnail for video first (put number of likes/number of views in the left corner).
    Allow to scroll tiles (don't show scroll bar)
    If tile clicked, show 25% thumb, title and beginning of the description and a small youtube button (to open video on youtube or in app)
    Only one tile should show details. If other tile clicked, change other back to thumbnail.

    Tiles shouldn't overlap. I believe we need to get # of likes and # of views from API, At the moment I see N/A
    When I click tile it still shows thumb taking full tile. I want to see all on tile: small thumb, title and beginning of the description
    # of likes and # of views should be in the left bottom of tile which was not clicked (all of them) and hidden once we have tile open
    with other information.

    New design for Videos.
    - let's have grid of tiles, tiles are not overlapping and hold grid position. There should be no less than 2 columns no more than 5.
    - the grid should be scrollable without scrollbar
    - tiles should be 16:9
    - each tile associated with one video
    - tile can be "open" or "closed", initial state for all tiles "closed"
    - in closed state tile shows video thumbnail taking whole space with # likes and # of views in the left corner (keep font small)
    - once tile clicked it changes state "open"
    - only one tile can be open at the time
    - in "open" state, tile shows small thumbnail, title and the beginning of description and youtube button to open video in youtube or app

    We need a few fixes. Let's fix title first. It appears in different fonts for desktop and mobil. I prefer mobile.
    But on mobile it takes about 90% of screen width, let change aspect to make it look slim

    I don't quite like design for menu.
    I want more obvious distinction between first level menu and sub-menu:
    First level: Categories; Videos; Contact; About
    Sub-menu for Categories: (folder names from dropbox)
    Sub-menu for Videos: music videos; dance videos

    Don't allow to click on Categories or Videos, only sub-menu for them.
    When selected sub-menu for Categories show Categories component instead of Slideshow. For now show only category name at the centre
    When selected sub-menu for Videos show Videos with sub-menu name at the centre for now

    Clicking contact should open instagram messanger to @dlikane
    Clicking about should open About component with "About" shown as a placeholder
    Add menu item at the top Home which would bring us back to original screen with Slideshow


    Show on main screen menu.svg to the left in the header
    Once clicked show menu items
    categories (get the list of categories and a query to dropbox via service - make another one api/categories)
    videos (hardcode sub-menus: music videos; dance)
    contact
    about
    If categories sub-menu clicked - open new Category component (placeholder) with category name passed as a parameter (we will deal with it later)
    If videos sub-menu clicked - open new Videos component (placeholder) with sub-menu name passed as a parameter (we will deal with it later)
    For contact go to instagram messanger @dlikane
    for about open open placeholder component



- categories (names of folders)
    - studio
    - dance
    - street
- videos
    music videos (Youtube MyVideos) different leve of participation
    edc
- insta msg
- about

Show svg above quote "Click for More"
    generate svg which would indicate: "click here for more information, next" as a round clickable image which would work both on mobile and desktop. That to be used to indicate that if clicked anywhere on the screen the next portion information would follow

Ok, let's re-think the whole logic.
I want to:
- when open site I want to display header and tagline as it is at the moment
- footer should always stay at bottom
- allow slide show to take whole area between taglien and footer
- show me.jpg straight away fitting slide area and "welcome" in caption
- prepare slide show and once it is ready ease out initial image and caption
- get in the cycle
- get list of images from dropbox (url and caption)
- select 3-5 images for the cycle
- caption stays where it is now
- wade in and out images and captions together
- caption keeps size, images zoom in as they wade in and zoom out as the wade out about 5%
- images fit width and height
- the last image stays on
- get random quote from dropbox
- wade in quote
- stay until a click
- keep quote and image on until next cycle is ready
- wade out image and quote and start next cycle
