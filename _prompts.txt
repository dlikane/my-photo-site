Ok, let's re-think the whole logic.
I want to:
- when open site I want to display header and tagline as it is at the moment
- footer should always stay at bottom
- allow slide show to take whole area between taglien and footer
- show me.jpg straight away fitting slide area and "welcome" in caption
- prepare slide show and once it is ready ease out initial image and caption
- get in the cycle
- get list of images from dropbox (url and caption)
- select 3-5 images for the cycle
- caption stays where it is now
- wade in and out images and captions together
- caption keeps size, images zoom in as they wade in and zoom out as the wade out about 5%
- images fit width and height
- the last image stays on
- get random quote from dropbox
- wade in quote
- stay until a click
- keep quote and image on until next cycle is ready
- wade out image and quote and start next cycle
