    We need a few fixes. Let's fix title first. It appears in different fonts for desktop and mobil. I prefer mobile.
    But on mobile it takes about 90% of screen width, let change aspect to make it look slim

    Please use older files for reference only if you have any. Here is list of current files:

    I don't quite like design for menu.
    I want more obvious distinction between first level menu and sub-menu:
    First level: Categories; Videos; Contact; About
    Sub-menu for Categories: (folder names from dropbox)
    Sub-menu for Videos: music videos; dance videos

    Don't allow to click on Categories or Videos, only sub-menu for them.
    When selected sub-menu for Categories show Categories component instead of Slideshow. For now show only category name at the centre
    When selected sub-menu for Videos show Videos with sub-menu name at the centre for now

    Clicking contact should open instagram messanger to @dlikane
    Clicking about should open About component with "About" shown as a placeholder
    Add menu item at the top Home which would bring us back to original screen with Slideshow


    Show on main screen menu.svg to the left in the header
    Once clicked show menu items
    categories (get the list of categories and a query to dropbox via service - make another one api/categories)
    videos (hardcode sub-menus: music videos; dance)
    contact
    about
    If categories sub-menu clicked - open new Category component (placeholder) with category name passed as a parameter (we will deal with it later)
    If videos sub-menu clicked - open new Videos component (placeholder) with sub-menu name passed as a parameter (we will deal with it later)
    For contact go to instagram messanger @dlikane
    for about open open placeholder component



- categories (names of folders)
    - studio
    - dance
    - street
- videos
    music videos (Youtube MyVideos) different leve of participation
    edc
- insta msg
- about

Show svg above quote "Click for More"
    generate svg which would indicate: "click here for more information, next" as a round clickable image which would work both on mobile and desktop. That to be used to indicate that if clicked anywhere on the screen the next portion information would follow

Ok, let's re-think the whole logic.
I want to:
- when open site I want to display header and tagline as it is at the moment
- footer should always stay at bottom
- allow slide show to take whole area between taglien and footer
- show me.jpg straight away fitting slide area and "welcome" in caption
- prepare slide show and once it is ready ease out initial image and caption
- get in the cycle
- get list of images from dropbox (url and caption)
- select 3-5 images for the cycle
- caption stays where it is now
- wade in and out images and captions together
- caption keeps size, images zoom in as they wade in and zoom out as the wade out about 5%
- images fit width and height
- the last image stays on
- get random quote from dropbox
- wade in quote
- stay until a click
- keep quote and image on until next cycle is ready
- wade out image and quote and start next cycle
