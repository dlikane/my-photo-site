Ok, I want to modify Slideshow to do the following:

Get list of images as it does now
Select a few randome images between 3 and 5 and show them with the disolve and slight zoom in/out effect 10%, keep the latest image displayed
Transition 2 seconds stay up for 3 seconds
Get list of quotes from /api/quotes, choose one randomly
As the last image is displayed, show the quote on top of it in a very nice neat font
Quote is pipe delimited file with first field Author and second quote itself
Display quote in the right bottom corner taking no more than 25% of space
File name comes in form itme1_item2_ etc, can be a few items. Show them as an image caption on the top of image, taking small neat font
If slideshow is clicked while rotating throuhg images, keep rotating.
if slideshow is clicked while standing, hide the quote and start another 3 to 5 images
